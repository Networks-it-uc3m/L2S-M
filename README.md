# L2S-M 
Welcome to the official repository of L2S-M, a **Kubernetes operator** that enables virtual networking in K8s clusters.

Link-Layer Secure connectivity for Microservice platforms (L2S-M) is a K8s networking solution that complements the CNI plugin approach of K8s to create and manage virtual networks in K8s clusters. These virtual networks allow workloads (pods) to have isolated link-layer connectivity with other pods in a K8s cluster, regardless of the k8s node where they are actually deployed. L2S-M enables the creation/deletion of virtual networks on-demand, as well as attaching/detaching pods to that networks. The solution is seamlessly integrated within the K8s environment, through a K8s operator.

L2S-M provides its intended functionalities using a programmable data-plane based on Software Defined Networking (SDN), which in turn provides a high degree of flexibility to dynamically incorporate new application and/or network configurations into K8s clusters. Moreover, L2S-M has been designed to flexibly accommodate various deployment options, ranging from small K8s clusters to those with a high number of distributed nodes. 

The main K8s interface of pods remains intact (provided by a CNI plugin), retaining the compatibility with all the standard K8s elements (e.g., services, connectivity through the main interface, etc.). Moreover, the solution has the potential to be used for inter-cluster communications to support scenarios where network functions are spread through multiple distributed infrastructures (this is still a work in progress).  

The figure outlines the design of L2S-M. See [how L2S-M works](https://github.com/Networks-it-uc3m/L2S-M/tree/main/K8s) to read further details on the L2S-M solution.

If you want to learn how to install L2S-M in your cluster, see the [installation guide](https://github.com/Networks-it-uc3m/L2S-M/tree/main/operator) of this repository to start its installation.

Did you already install the operator and  you cannot wait to start building your own virtual networks in your K8s cluster? Check out our [ping-pong](https://github.com/Networks-it-uc3m/L2S-M/tree/main/descriptors) example!

### Additional information about L2S-M
In the [following section](https://github.com/Networks-it-uc3m/L2S-M/tree/main/additional%20info) of the repository, you can find a series of documents and slides that provide additional information about L2S-M, including presentations where our solution has been showcased to the public in various events.

L2S-M has been presented in the following events:

* [Open Source Mano (OSM) #13 plenary meeting (01/06/2022)](https://github.com/Networks-it-uc3m/L2S-M/blob/main/additional%20info/OSM%2313%20Plenary%20Meeting.pdf): In this meeting, L2S-M was presented as a solution to enable virtual networking to deploy Cloud Network Functions (CNFs) in K8s clusters. Moreover, the potential use of L2S-M to become the basis for a feature to be introduced in OSM's code was discussed as well.
