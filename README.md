# L2S-M 
Welcome to the official repository of L2S-M, a Kubernetes operator that enables virtual networking in K8s clusters.

In the previous figure, you can see an example architecture of L2S-M in a K8s cluster. In principle, L2S-M builds a programmable data plane between different programmable switches deployed (or present) over a K8s cluster. These switches can be either physical (like they can be found in a classic datacentre infrastructure) or virtual (deployed by the L2S-M operator). 

**NOTE**: The current verison only supports the deployment of virtual switches based on [Open Virtual Switch (OVS)](http://www.openvswitch.org), and the solution creates several vEth pairs in the host to attach virtualised workloads to the virtual switches. 

Each one of these switches are interconnected with selected peers by taking advantage of IP tunneling mechanisms (vxlan), building an overlay of programmable switches. Aftearwards, an SDN Application is used to inject the corresponding traffic rules to ensure that traffic between virtual network are isolated between each other (i.e., instrucing the switches which ports should be used to forwards and/or block incoming-outgoing traffic).

Specifically for K8s clusters, the element in charge of managing the creation, deletion and management of virtual networks is the L2S-M operator. This operator treats virtual networks as Multus CRDs, using the K8s events to detect the instances where a pod wants to attach/detach from a virtual network. In the former case, the operator will select one of the  available vEth interfaces and associate it with the virtual network that wants to be deployed. More information on how to deploy virtualise workloads attached to virtual networks can be seen in the [ping-pong](https://github.com/Networks-it-uc3m/L2S-M/tree/main/descriptors) example.

If you want to learn how to install L2S-M in your cluster, see the [installation guide](https://github.com/Networks-it-uc3m/L2S-M/tree/main/operator) of this repository to start its installation.

If you want more information about the original idea of L2S-M and its initial design, you can check our latest publication in the [IEEE Network journal](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9740640).

Did you already install the operator and  you cannot wait to start building your own virtual networks in your K8s cluster? Check out our [ping-pong](https://github.com/Networks-it-uc3m/L2S-M/tree/main/descriptors) example!
